* dmenu-custom
  Custom script for running programs using [[http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]].
** How does it work?
   1. Show a list of programs (from =/bin=) with dmenu (like normal)
      - Add website names from =~/.dmenu-web= (if that file exists)
   2. After choosing a program:
      1. If it's a website name, open Chromium without browser chrome
         (tabs/buttons/etc)
      2. If it's a program listed in =~/.dmenu-terminal=, open it in a terminal
         with =urxvt -e $program=.
      3. Otherwise, open it normally.
** The format of =~/.dmenu-web=
#+BEGIN_SRC
# comments start with a # sign
# url,keyword,optional-keyword
https://github.com/,gh,github
#+END_SRC
  Note: You can have multiple keywords per URL. If you don't specify any, the
  whole URL will show up in dmenu (maybe you prefer that).
** Hooking it up to XMonad
  It's easy to run this from XMonad, here's how I do it:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
import XMonad
import XMonad.Util.EZConfig

main = xmonad $ defaultConfig
        `additionalKeysP`
        [ ("M-p" , spawn '"$HOME/.bin/dmenu-custom"') ]
#+END_SRC
